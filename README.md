# Programming Language Style Guides

A collection of style guides for programming languages, designed to promote consistent, readable, and maintainable code across different projects and teams. It serves as a central resource for language specific best practices, conventions, and standards.

## Core Principles

Style guides in this repository follow these core principles:

- **Self-Documenting Code**: Code should be clear enough that comments are rarely needed
- **Consistency Over Perfection**: Consistent patterns are more valuable than perfect ones
- **Practicality**: Guidelines should be actionable and easy to follow
- **Evolution**: Style guides evolve based on feedback and best practices
